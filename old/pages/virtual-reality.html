					<h1>Virtual Reality: Utopia of the 21th century?</h1>
					<p>
						<b>Virtual Reality</b> can be summarized with two single words: “What if?” 
						What if you were in a world where you are able to be the King of an empire? 
						What if you were on the seat of a spaceship heading to Mars? 
						What if everything could become <b>real</b>?
					</p>
					<p>
						Since the premises of Science Fiction, we started to dream of a possibility to create a new world, 
						a new reality where we would be able to do whatever we want. 
						From Neuromancer to Matrix through Sword Art Online, 
						we became more and more convinced of the feasibility of creating a virtual reality. 
						For the past 20 years, technologies have improved significantly, 
						leaving our expectations high for the field of Virtual Reality. 
						With the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/22/facebook-oculus-rift-acquisition-virtual-reality" target="_blank">acquisition of the Oculus VR company by Facebook</a> in March 2014, 
						a new wave of companies jumped in this new market. 
						However, since the announcement of the price of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/01/08/oculus-ceo-brendan-iribe-explains-why-the-rift-has-a-600-price-tag/" target="_blank">Oculus Rift ($600)</a> 
						followed by the <a href="http://attackofthefanboy.com/news/htc-vive-price-200-higher-oculus-rift-release-date-set-april/" target="_blank">HTC Vive($800)</a>, 
						a stack of article titled about “<a href="http://www.geek.com/news/the-dream-of-virtual-reality-is-dead-for-now-1647884/" target="_blank">The end of Virtual Reality</a>”. 
						Is Virtual Reality over-hyped and will it make a difference to the games industry? 
						Let’s jump into Virtual Reality, our expectations and its possible outcomes.

					<h2>Failing all over again</h2>
					<p>
						We can trace back actual implementation of VR (Virtual Reality) systems for video games 
						in 1989 with the commercial introduction of the Power Glove, a controller accessory for 
						the Nintendo Entertainment System. 
						Using multiple sensors, the glove allowed the detection of the hand movement of the player, 
						rendering it inside the game. T
						he glove itself, with a price of $75, was a commercial success, selling more than 100,000 of its units. 
						Only two games were released for the Power Glove, however, 
						both games were criticized for its imprecise and difficult-to-use controls, 
						diving the overall technology into a critical and commercial failure. 
						But was only the beginning of a still-growing list of VR devices failing to deliver its promises.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1991, Sega announced the Sega VR headset. Two versions were developed: for the Mega Drive and for the arcade. 
						At this point, the magazine Computer Gaming World announced “<a href="http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=100" target="_blank">Affordable VR by 1994</a>”. 
						But, due to development difficulties, only the latter was released, while the console version vanished from release schedules in 1994. 
						As the official reason was “a too realistic effect which could make the user injure himself while moving”, 
						it is more probable that it was canceled because there were reports of testers developing headaches and motion sickness.
					</p>
					<figure>

					</figure>
					<p>
						Then, it was Nintendo’s turn to try his VR headset into the market: The Virtual Boy was realized in 1995 at a price of 179$. 
						The company tried a massive promotion campaign spending around $25 million. 
						Sadly for the marketing team, the Virtual Boy failed for number of reasons. 
						Geoff King and Tanya Krzywinska, in their book “Tomb Raiders and Space Invaders: Videogame Forms and Contexts” 
						noted the following reason: “its high price, the discomfort caused by play […] 
						and what was widely judged to have been a poorly handled marketing campaign.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Between 1989 and 2000, every attempt to create a mainstream VR device ended up disappointing the consumers 
						and became critical and commercial failure. 
						The reason why it didn’t fall in oblivion was of the popular culture using them as joke.
					</p>

					<h2>Virtual Reality IV: A New Hope</h2>
					<p>
						Disappointed by the poor quality of the VR headset, no company tried itself upon building “The next Big Thing” in video games. 
						Then, in 2012, a titan in the game industry, John Carmack (Doom, Wolfenstein 3D, Quake) started to demonstrate a new device, 
						created by a complete stranger in the industry: Palmer Luckey. 
						The Oculus Rift, titled “the first truly immersive virtual reality headset for video games”, 
						promised a completely new experience of gaming for an affordable price (around $300). 
						Endorsed by Carmack and then by other gaming giants, such as Gabe Newell of Valve, 
						Palmer launched <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1523379957/oculus-rift-step-into-the-game" target="_blank">a Kickstarter campaign</a> which obtained $2,500,000 over the initial $250,000 with the help of over 9000 backers!
					</p>
					<p>
						Followed by the complete success of the campaign, a large group of technology and gaming enthusiast evoked 
						the “new age of gaming” and everybody started to lose its mind over it.
					</p>

					<p>
						And not only gamers: Mark Zuckerberg, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck" target="_blank">who needs no introduction</a>, 
						acquired the newly-fund company, Oculus VR, in 2014 for $2 billion, 
						propelling the VR excitement to a new level, increasing the numbers of search by nearly 900% on Google!
					</p>

					</figure>
					<p>
						As of the writing of this article, never the number of VR devices in development have been this high. 
						Being able to choose either the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR, Gear VR, Google Cardboard and others, 
						is a good hint into the feasibility and the potential of such a technology. 
						Indeed, why would so many companies invest and develop a VR headset, if they didn’t believe it’s time for a good VR device?
					</p>
					<h2>Another Brick in the Wall of failed VR?</h2>
					<p>
						So here we are, excited about all that VR, waiting for the commercial release of these devices. 
						And then, disappointment: the pre-orders for the Oculus Rift tagged the price of $600, 
						instantly creating a wave of angry gamers, arguing it was over-priced. 
						Soon after, the HTC Vive announced its own price, being even higher: $800. 
						As written in an article titled: “<a href="http://www.geek.com/news/the-dream-of-virtual-reality-is-dead-for-now-1647884/" target="_blank">The dream of virtual reality is dead for now</a>”, 
						it became clear that the customer is now in the position of either 
						“buying an extremely expensive system-tethered headsets with features, 
						or inexpensive but underwhelming plastic shells for your cell phone.” 
						The latter is a reference for the Google Cardboard, which lets you use your smartphone 
						as a screen for a cardboard VR device.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you read the first paragraph of this article, you should get a sensation of <i>déjà vu</i>, 
						as an over-hyped technology eventually ends up disappointing the players.
					</p>
					<h2>Breaking the Wheel of failed innovation</h2>
					<figure>
						<img src="img/vr/wheel.jpg" alt="Daenerys Targaryen" style="">
						<figcaption>Khaleesi, eager to have a good VR ecosystem</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						But even with the similarity between the 2014 VR wave and the 1991 wave, we ought to seek the differences. 
						First, VR technology increased at a fast pace for the last 20 years. 
						When the first wave had a 300x200 display, we now achieve 2160x1200. 
						When they had only two to four games per device, the Oculus Rift is already featured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_with_Oculus_Rift_support" target="_blank">in more than 200 games</a>! 
						Also, Unity 3D, currently one of the most used game engine, allow to build an Oculus-compatible game <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/game-engines/latest/concepts/unity-tutorial-rollaball-intro/" target="_blank">pretty easily</a>. 
						It’s clear that we are in a different environment than 20 years ago and that the VR ecosystem may be viable after all.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let’s break point by point the reasons why people are reluctant to VR:
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>“The price is too high”:</b>
						$600-800 IS expensive and it is a reasonable reason. H
						owever, more and more people buy gaming-focused PC costing up to $1000 or smartphone priced at more than $500. 
						Therefore, buying an expensive VR device could be an option more conceivable. 
						Also, being in the beginning of this new wave of VR devices, 
						we can consider a decrease of the price over the next five years, making it affordable for more consumers.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>“It’s a gadget”:</b>
						While it could appear as being a gadget adding a superficial layer to video games, 
						a recurring comment by those who tried an Oculus Rift was that it was overwhelmingly awesome 
						and was really adding a new dimension to gaming. 
						Speaking of gadget, 10 years ago, who would believe we could assemble a TV, a computer, a compass, a calendar, 
						internet, and games in a single phone? 
						Well, Apple tried with the iPhone and now, we nearly all have a smartphone of our own. 
						Also, while speaking about Video Games, let’s not forget all the other applications where VR can achieve an audience: 
						Education, Training, Art, Architectural or Industrial Design; or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_therapy" target="_blank">Therapy</a>. 
						In each of these applications, VR can expend to improve the technology 
						and allow a sustainable VR environment which was missing during the first wave.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>“It will only find a small portion of users”:</b>
						Following the expensive price argument, we can believe that only a group of wealthy players could afford to buy such devices. 
						However, as explained in the two first points, if VR achieve to give a new dimension to gaming and the price was to decrease, 
						we are able to affirm that a significant portion of users will be a part of the VR environment. 
						One of the examples of the demand of a VR headset is the anime Sword Art Online, 
						where you are in a Fantasy World and have to beat the levels of the game. 
						It is an inspiration to gamers, and many hope to play such a game. 
						This is why <a href="http://kotaku.com/ibm-is-making-sword-art-online-for-real-1760758238" target="_blank">IBM Japan is developing such a game</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>“It sincerely scares me”:</b>
						Well, yes, the first comment for the following picture, posted by Mark Zuckerberg, 
						is “Damn, it’s kind of creepy”, following by “The future looks fucked up”. 
						But let’s do a little time travel here. 
						20 years ago, Internet was considered as a joke and, in 2004, the presenter of The Daily Show, John Stewart, 
						mocked the idea of cellphones with camera in them. 
						When put in perspective of the years, it is safe to assume that this picture, 
						while being seen as creepy now, will be considered normal in 15 years.
					</p>

						<figcaption>Mark Zuckerberg, walking to the stand at the Mobile World Congress</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<h2>It's not only about Video Games</h2>
					<p>
						One of the reason it will be considered as normal is because of the Educational use of these VR headset. 
						Indeed, we already started to watch VR-based courses flourish in schools or universities. 
						For example, the Mendel Grammar School in Opava City, Czech Republic, <a href="http://www.roadtovr.com/world-of-comenius-virtual-reality-education-biology-lesson-leap-motion-oculus-rift-dk2/" target="_blank">housed the project World of Comenius</a>, 
						where students could use Oculus Rift mounted with Leap Motion sensors. 
						They were able to have a virtual biology and anatomy lesson, using their own hands to interact with the virtual world. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Following this <a href="http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2014/09/5-ways-virtual-reality-will-change-education/" target="_blank">article</a>, we can enumerate five ways that VR will improve education: 
						<ul>
							<li>Greater collaboration and social integration</li>
							<li>Making new experiences possible</li>
							<li>Increased student motivation</li>
							<li>New rewards with a focus on positive stimulation</li>
							<li>Inspiring creative learning</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

						<figcaption>A group of children playing <a href="http://alchemylearning.com/" target="_blank">Alchemy Learning</a></figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Also, one of the purposes of the acquisition of Oculus VR by Facebook was to pursue the development of VR in the Social domain. 
						Recently, in November 2015, Oculus VR released the first social virtual word app called “<a href="http://www.roadtovr.com/video-hands-on-with-oculus-social-enabling-shared-experiences-on-gear-vr/" target="_blank">Oculus Social alpha</a>”. 
						It allows the user to have an avatar and being dropped into a movie theatre with 4 others users, where you can watch a Twitch video. 
						While being a simplistic app, it is the premises of a new generation of Social VR app. 
						And maybe, one day, we will be able to discuss in a <a href="http://psychopass.wikia.com/wiki/CommuField" target="_blank">CommuField</a> as in the anime Psycho-Pass.
					</p>
					<h2>I believe in Virtual Reality</h2>
					<p>
						I know, I’m optimistic or maybe an utopist, but I believe that Virtual Reality is going to happen. 
						Proved by the multiple devices developed throughout the years, 
						I’m not the only one believing that an affordable, enjoyable and game-changing Virtual Reality device can be achieved. 
						While being developed since 1952, 3D movies didn’t achieve a considerable audience and mainstream appraisable until early 2000. 
						It gives hope for the newly-developed Virtual Reality to be, one day, a mainstream device to our daily lives.
					</p>
					<p>
						Alongside Virtual Reality, we are also seeing premises of Augmented Reality with the Hololens by Microsoft, 
						rendering virtual assets to our field of vision, therefore augmenting our “reality”. 
						With the VR environment increasing in size each day, we can believe in a bright future for this technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Yes. We will</b> enter a world where we are the king of an empire. 
						<b>We will</b> be seated in a spaceship heading to Mars. 
						<b>We will</b> be able to make everything we want <b>real</b>.
